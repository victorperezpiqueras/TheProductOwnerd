// `.env.ts` is generated by the `npm run env` command
// `npm run env` exposes environment variables as JSON for any usage you might
// want, like displaying the version or getting extra config from your CI bot, etc.
// This is useful for granularity you might need beyond just the environment.
// Note that as usual, any environment variables you expose through it will end up in your
// bundle, and you should not use it for any sensitive information like passwords or keys.
// import { env } from 'src/environments/.env';
